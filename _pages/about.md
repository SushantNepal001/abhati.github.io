I am Associate Professor of Political Science and Director of the Asian Studies Program at [Bowling Green State University](http://bgsu.edu/).

My overarching research agenda lies at the intersection of nonprofit and civil society organizations, political science, and public administration. In particular, I am interested in understanding how nonprofits generate resources and the role they play in reducing structural social, economic, and political inequalities in society. I also study the role played by the state in either promoting and/or curtailing the freedom of nonprofits and civil societies both in the U.S. and comparatively.

I also serve as a member of the planning commission at the [City of Bowling Green, Ohio](https://www.bgohio.org/) and as a Trustee at the [Bowling Green Community Foundation](https://www.bgohcf.org/).

I received my B.A. in Business Economics from the [University of Delhi](http://www.du.ac.in), M.A. in Social Entrepreneurship from the [Tata Institute of Social Sciences](http://tiss.edu/) in Mumbai, and Ph.D. in Public Administration from the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](http://unomaha.edu/).
